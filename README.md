This project is a university project given by the lecturer in one of the course at Computer Science. This website is about something like bakery 
that offer cakes, bread, and some drinks with pre order mechanism for customer who want to buy it. This also include with some administration functionality.
<br>
Here are the actor of this website:
- Customer

<br>

> NOTE!
> This Atma Kitchen thing i'm not sure if there is any real company or something like that with exactly the same products and all the system created in this website
> so this is in my opinion just for a sake of problem solving test on my university.
